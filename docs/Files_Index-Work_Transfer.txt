Work Transfer

/BAGEL and MAGeCK
	/Data_copy
		-Raw read counts and groups
		-Aggregation of the groups replicates

		/readcountNorm
			Normalization of the read counts and Log2FC computing

	/FDR_Datasets
		Dataframes used to compute the FDR of essential genes according to gene expression after BAGEL/MAGeCK processing and retrieving gene expression level from "False discovery rate calculation and replicates.csv"

	/training_bjorklund
	/training_Hart
	/training_RNAi
		different schemes to retrieve the essential genes lists to test different BAGEL inputs

	-"Compare_FDR_all.R" : plot the FDR after BAGEL/MAGeCK processing
	-"ess_rep2_MAGECK.csv" : 1340 essential genes identified
	-"False discovery rate calculation and replicates.csv" : expression levels from the 14K genes of the pooled CRISPR screen
	-"getfullDF_from_BF&FDR.R" : retrieve the outputs from BAGEL and create the final dataframes to compare the FDR



/Machine_Learning
	/ML_notebooks
		Jupyter notebooks developped to identify the ML models and compare their efficiencies

	-"Analysis-..." : predictions of the appropriate ML models and comparison of these predictions in "Analysis-Compare Predictions.R"
	-"ML-..." : dataframes used to train the ML models
	-"Preprocessing-Distance.R" : script to retrieve the distance from the PAM to the start of the exon (feature eventually not used in the ML model building phase)
	-"ToPredict_..." : raw sgRNAs of the training set on which to make predictions



/Master Thesis
	LATEX files, biliography, drafts and manuscrispt for the Thesis



/Papers&Docs
	Scientific papers 



/sgRNA_efficiency_prediction
	Prediction command line tool, see https://github.com/PierreMkt/Dmel-sgRNA-Efficiency-Prediction



/sgRNAs_targeting_Essential_Genes
	Rstudio scripts to retrieve the sgRNAs targeting essential genes, retrieve the 30mer sequence from the exome and create the test set too.



/strand_analysis
	small Rscript to analyse if the strand targeted by the sgRNA (same as gene or not) impacts the KO efficiency
